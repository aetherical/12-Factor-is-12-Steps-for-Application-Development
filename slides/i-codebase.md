----

### One Codebase <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

(Tracked in Revision Control) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Many Deploys <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note:
	I think it pretty much goes without saying any more that every
	project needs to have a codebase. In that sense, there really
	isn't a whole lot to disagree about regarding this particular factor.
