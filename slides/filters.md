> “In the Information Age, the first step to sanity is FILTERING. Filter the information: extract for knowledge.

> 
> Filter third for reliability. This filter protects against politicians.
> 
> Filter fourth for completeness. This filter protects against the media.”

	Heroku is in the business of providing a platform for cloud-based software.
	As a result, they are motivated to assist others in creating better
	cloud-based software. That's not to say that 12 Factors is totally
