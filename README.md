12 Factor is 12 Steps for Application Development
=================================================

Originally devised by Heroku, a twelve factor application is a
methodology for building software-as-a-service applications.

12 Factor will change the way that you develop software and how you
think about software. The first step, though, is to recognize that we
have a problem -- traditional methods of developing software are
unmanageable. They do not easily scale. Dependencies are hard to
isolate. Concurrency is hard.  Logging and monitoring are an after
thought. Backing services are closely coupled. Servers and
applications follow the 4-H model -- we raise them with loving, 
devoted care until it's time to slaughter them.

12 Factor addresses these issues and many more.

This session discusses the 12 Factors and why they are
important. 12 Factor adopts best practices related to application and
infrastructure support and development, including:

   * Parity between development and production
   * Logging
   * Stateless services
   * Codebase/SCM
   * Separation of build & run stages

Seriously... 12 Factor will change the way you think about application
development and support.
